# Range 2

## Description

Range 2 is a CAS training range consisting of a basic CAS training area as well as several CAS tactical training scenarios

## General range setting

The following are the mission settings upon starting a CAS training scenario. Some of settings can be altered for each group by entering TACTICAL COMMANDER or GAME MASTER roles and adjust specific group settings to maximize training effectiveness as needed.

1) All BLUE units and RED units are set to HOLD FIRE (Meaning: won't be shooting at enemy units even if such units enters their range and LOS)
2) All RED are HIDDEN ON MAP (Meaning: will not show up on the F10 map unless when entering GAME MASTER role).
NOTE: in the BASIC CAS scenario, there are BLUE units that are also HIDDEN on the map to support VID practice. 
4) All RED units are set to ALERT STATE RED (Radars and missile turrets are erected and active as they would be seen during a combat situation)
5) All JTAC-intended units are set - in addition to the above - as INVISIBLE and IMMORTAL (Meaning: Will not attract enemy fires, and will not be harmed even if hit by enemy or friendly fire)

## RANGE-2 BASIC CAS TRAINING SCENARIO
### Objectives:
1) The basic-CAS range is intended for procedural practice of CAS briefs and attack executions by JTACs and CAS pilots
2) The range also provides setting for practicing ID of friendly units for JTACs and CAS pilots


### Range layout:

In the middle of the range is the "JTAC hill" at: N37°16.2' E035°54.2' / 36S YG575288 / Elev. 400ft
On the hill are several MANPADs for use as JTACs
In the area to the West of JTAC-hill are an assortment of Eastern-bloc targets from infantry to armor, ADS etc., of types that are likely to be enc
Same types of targets are also in the East side of JTAC-hill, only there are also Western-type vehicle. This area is dedicated for the correct identification of unit types by JTAC and pilots.

## RANGE-2 CAS SCENARIO-1

### Situation:

1) Syrian forces are advancing from the South
2) A river crossing (Road bridge at N37°22.6' E035°28.2' / 36S YG187395 / Elev. 425ft) has been designated as a choke-point critical in our defensive efforts in the region.

### Enemy:

1) Estimated at mechanized battalion with organic recon, artillery, and air defense elements
2) Main axis of advance is from the South-East however our observers has spotted dust clouds to the East suggesting that a possible enemy flanking maneuver is taking place
3) Enemy forces use amphibious capable vehicles and expected to execute combat crossings in areas where the river is relatively thin and with flat banks suitable for tracked vehicles (Most likely South of the SOUTHERN DAM)

NOTE – The SOUTHERN DAM itself is sloped and not suitable for passage of any vehicle

### Friendlies:

1) Mechanized sections (M2 BRADLEYs in defensive positions on both sides of the river
2) RECON/JTAC vehicles (ATGM and SCOUT HMMWVs)
3) 120mm mortars for artillery support, collocated with the RECON/JTAC vehicles on the West bank of the river

### Mission:

1) Engage enemy forces approaching the river or crossing it
2) Prevent the enemy from establishing a bridgehead

## RANGE-2 CAS SCENARIO-3

### Situation:

1) A critical MSR running E-W passes between two ridgelines creating a tactical chokepoint.
2) The Syrian army has established a defensive line in the area to block allied forces advancing from the East to the West.

### Enemy:

Enemy strength estimated at a mechanized battalion with its organic elements of recon, air defenses and artillery.

### Friendlies:

### Mission:

1) Secure the bridge (at N37°22.8' E035°49.6' / 36S YG503408 / Elev.208ft) and the road leading up to it from the East to support the movement of the remainder of the brigade towards the West later today.
2) Clear the Southern ridge and Northern ridge of enemy presence to facilitate safe approach of allied forces to the AO.
